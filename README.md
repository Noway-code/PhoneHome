# Phone Home

## Project Overview

*Phone Home* is a web-based application, offering users a space alien-themed contact management experience. Utilizing Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project combines visually appealing elements like animated stars and reactive logos with essential contact management functionalities.

## Features

User authentication is mandatory, requiring users to log in or sign up. The registration mechanism allows new users to register by providing necessary details. Core contact management features include the ability to add, search, edit, and delete personal contacts. The user interface boasts a clean and professional design for enhanced user-friendliness.

## Technology Used

The project leverages Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, while the backend is powered by the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). Hosting is on Digital Ocean, with a remote database storing user information and contacts. JSON facilitates communication between the client and server, and at least one API endpoint is demonstrated using SwaggerHub.
